Cereals makes it easy to serialize ruby objects to JSON.
Cereals provides serializer classes for single objects and collections.

Cereals depends on ActiveSupport's `#to_json` and `#to_hash` implementations.

## Install

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "cereals"
```

## Usage

Include the `Cereals::Base` module in the classes you want to serialize.
If you're using Rails 5+, add it to `ApplicationRecord` like so:

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord
  include Cereals::Base
end
```

Note: the above `include` will override `#to_json` for all models, so if you don't
want that to happen, do something else.

Create serializer classes with names corresponding to your models.
Implement `#to_hash` on each serializer.

```ruby
class UserSerializer < Cereals::Serializer
  def to_hash
    {
      first_name: @object.first_name,
      last_name: @object.last_name
    }
end
```

Rails renderers take care of calling `#to_json` when you render json.
When you include the `Cereals::Base` module in an object that is
rendered, the `to_json` call made by rails will instantiate a serializer
corresponding to the object and call `to_json` on the serializer.

For example, when you see `render json: user`, here is what happens:

* `render` calls `to_json` on `user`.
* `user#to_json` is defined in `Cereals::Base`.
* Cereals creates a new `UserSerializer`, which wraps `user`.
* `Cereals::Base#to_json` returns the serializer object, which receives
the `to_json` call from rails.
* `UserSerializer#to_json` is defined in the base `Cereals::Serializer` class,
which calls `#to_hash` in `UserSerializer`.

A JSON API might look like this:

```ruby
class UsersController
  def show
    user = User.find(params[:id])
    render json: user
  end

  def index
    users = User.all
    render json: Cereals::ArraySerializer.new(users, "users")
  end
end
```

## JSON Format

Single objects have a root node.

`UserSerializer.new(user).to_json`

```
{
  "user": {
    "first_name":"Bart",
    "last_name":"Simpson"
  }
}
```

Arrays have a root node, and items within the array do not.

`ArraySerializer.new([user1, user2]).to_json`

```
{
  "users": [
    {
      "first_name":"Bart",
      "last_name":"Simpson"
    },
    {
      "first_name":"Lisa",
      "last_name":"Simpson"
    }    
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Specify a different serializer class for a model:

```ruby
class User
  def serializer_class
    PersonSerializer
  end
end
```

Specify a different root name for a serializer:

```ruby
class UserSerializer
  private

  def root_name
    "person"
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive REPL.
